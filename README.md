# Critical thinking and clinical decision-making among registered nurses in clinical practice: A systematic review and meta-analysis"

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code for a systematic review and meta-analysis on critical thinking and clinical decision-making among registered nurses in clinical practice. The study aimed to identify and synthesize findings from relevant research, assess the quality of the q studies, and explore factors influencing these skills.

## Abstract

Introduction: 
Critical thinking and clinical decision-making in nursing refer to the learned skills that increase the quality of care. These cognitive         processes enable nurses to analyse complex information and select the most appropriate course of action in the clinical settings.

Objective:
To identify the studies on critical thinking and clinical decision-making among nurses in clinical practice and synthesise their findings based on the regional area, the observed findings, the predictive factors, and to assess the measurement tools used.

Method:
We conducted a systematic review of the published critical thinking and clinical decision-making studies. A literature search for eligible studies was conducted in PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Subsequently, the studies with a similarly themed component were grouped for narrative synthesis. These subgroups were further divided into WHO (World Health Organization) regions, the type of observed skills, predictive factors, and measurement tools used. 

Results: 
Among 34 eligible studies from various global regions, 22 addressed critical thinking, 8 examined clinical decision-making, and 4 explored both skills. Diverse skill levels were observed for critical thinking and clinical decision-making, with a limited subset of measurement tools used in meta-analyses due to notable heterogeneity. Therefore, drawing definitive conclusions should be approached with caution. 

Conclusions:
Estimates from both critical thinking and clinical decision-making indicators indicate that a lack of consistency in observed findings of the skills. The pattern of assessment appears to have increased over the past few years. To attain more reliable and compelling results, it is imperative that future high-quality research employs instruments with robust psychometric properties.
